# The-Boredless-Tourist
An application giving you the power to find the parts of the city that fit the pace of your life. We at The Boredless Tourist run a recommendation engine using Python. We first evaluate what a person’s interests are and then give them recommendations in their area to beaches, museums, zoos, and historical destinations that we think they’ll be engaged by.

**This project serves as the scaffolding for a potentially huge search engine that pairs someone planning on going on a trip to attractions in their vacation destination matching their interests. **

Destinations and attractions available can be expanded using existing libraries. Interests that correspond to each attraction can be exponentially increased using similar databases.

# Examples of functions included: 
- Function that allows administrators to add new attractions for each destination in the destinations library. Each is added along with their corresponding interests for that particular attraction.
- Function that matches user's interests to corresponding attractions that exhibit that interest in the destination they plan to visit.
- Final function: get_attractions_for_traveler(): When user inputs their name, destination they'd like to visit, and their interests, the function will return a statement with recommendations for attractions to visit that match their interests in their destination of choice!
